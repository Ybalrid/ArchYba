# ArchYba
Custom ArchLinux ISO with a collection of additional packages and configuration files.

I  :heart: ArchLinux, and I can install a base system by hand in minutes, but sometimes I want a bootable thingy with a GUI, just.. Well because.

So, this ISO is a perfectly normal ArchLinux ISO but with these changes : 

  - AZERTY keyboard on boot. I have to "loadkeys fr" all the time in Arch, so here, You'll have to "loadkeys us" to have QWERTY. That's for you, Americans.
  - 64bit only
  - X.org server and XFCE desktop installed
  - Bunch of cool programs including <del>armagetronad</del> vim, tmux and gparted are installed
  - /root/pacstrapYba.sh is a script you can run instead of the regular pacstrap to install ahh the custom stuff in a new arch installation. Otherwise, the installation is the same as with ArchLinux
  
  
 You need Archiso, and all the stuff that goes with it to build this project. Archiso is a script to make ArchLinux ISOs and is on the Arch official repositories. If you are on antoher linux distribution... Well, I may put a pre-built ISO of that stuff on the interwebz, but I doubt about the fact that anybody will be interested in this, ever.
